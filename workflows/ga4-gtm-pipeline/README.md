An n8n workflow that wires together three agents — [GA4 Monitor](../../agents/ga4-monitor/), [GA4 Gap Analyzer](../../agents/ga4-gap-analyzer/), and [GTM Implementer](../../agents/gtm-implementer/) — into a daily pipeline with Slack notifications and human approval gates.

Works for in-house teams monitoring a single property or agencies and consultants managing multiple GA4 properties and GTM containers.

## What It Does

Most analytics teams discover GA4 tracking gaps reactively — a dashboard goes blank, a stakeholder asks why conversions dropped, or someone notices a missing event six weeks after a deploy broke it.

This pipeline flips that. It runs daily, compares your live GA4 event data against a defined tracking spec, and catches tracking gaps and anomalies before anyone notices. GA4 anomaly detection flags volume drops and spikes; gap analysis identifies missing or misconfigured events. When it finds issues, it uses Claude to diagnose root causes, generate GTM implementation specs, and create the actual tags, triggers, and variables in a GTM workspace — all without publishing. A human reviews and approves before anything goes live.

**What it never does:**
- Publish a GTM container (workspace changes stay unpublished until a human publishes)
- Modify GA4 configuration (read-only access to GA4 Data API)
- Push code to any repository (dataLayer changes are flagged for eng teams)
- Skip the human approval gate

## Agents Used

This workflow orchestrates three standalone agents:

| Agent | Role in Pipeline | Can Use Standalone? |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **[GA4 Monitor](../../agents/ga4-monitor/)** | Compares GA4 events against tracking spec, flags gaps and anomalies | Yes — one-time audits, validation scripts |
| **[GA4 Gap Analyzer](../../agents/ga4-gap-analyzer/)** | Claude diagnoses gaps (Sonnet) and anomalies (Haiku) | Yes — manual analysis from any comparison data |
| **[GTM Implementer](../../agents/gtm-implementer/)** | Creates GTM resources from analysis output | Yes — manual GTM provisioning from specs |

## Prerequisites

| Requirement                      | Purpose                                                                         |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **n8n** (self-hosted)            | Workflow orchestration and scheduling                                           |
| **Google Cloud service account** | GA4 Data API (read) + GTM API (read/write)                                      |
| **GA4 property**                 | The property you want to monitor                                                |
| **GTM container**                | Where implementation changes are created                                        |
| **Claude API key**               | Sonnet for gap analysis, Haiku for anomaly detection                            |
| **Slack app**                    | Notifications, alerts, and approval requests (requires Slack admin permissions) |

### Google Cloud Setup

The service account needs two API scopes:

- **GA4 Data API v1** — read-only access to event data
- **GTM API v2** — read/write access to workspaces, tags, triggers, and variables (but **not** publish permission)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The service account should intentionally lack GTM publish permission. This is the technical enforcement of the approval gate — the agent literally cannot publish a container, even if the code tried.

## Setup

### 1. Create a Property Config

Define a JSON config per GA4 property following the schema in [`agents/ga4-monitor/schemas/client-config.schema.json`](../../agents/ga4-monitor/schemas/client-config.schema.json). This specifies the GA4 property ID, GTM container ID, schedule, Slack channel, and approvers.

```bash
# Validate your config
python agents/ga4-monitor/scripts/validate-client-config.py path/to/client-config.json
```

### 2. Create an Event Spec

Define the expected events for the property following the schema in [`agents/ga4-monitor/schemas/event-spec.schema.json`](../../agents/ga4-monitor/schemas/event-spec.schema.json). This is the source of truth the pipeline compares against.

```bash
# Validate your spec
python agents/ga4-monitor/scripts/validate-event-spec.py path/to/event-spec.json
```

### 3. Import n8n Workflows

Import the three workflow JSONs from `scripts/n8n-workflows/` into your n8n instance:

1. **main-pipeline.json** — the shared pipeline logic
2. **triggers.json** — per-property schedule triggers (customize for your properties)
3. **error-workflow.json** — global error handler with Slack alerts

### 4. Configure Credentials in n8n

Set up the following credentials in n8n:

- Google service account JSON (for GA4 + GTM)
- Claude API key
- Slack bot token

### 5. Test with Sample Data

Use [`agents/ga4-monitor/test-data/ga4-sample-response.json`](../../agents/ga4-monitor/test-data/ga4-sample-response.json) to dry-run the pipeline without hitting live APIs.

## How It Works

### The Daily Cycle

1. **Scheduled trigger fires** (per property, configurable cadence)
2. **GA4 fetch** pulls the current event inventory with counts from the last 7 days
3. **GA4 Monitor** checks events against the tracking spec — identifies missing events, unexpected events, and count anomalies (volume drops/spikes)
4. **If all clear:** Slack gets a green status message, a monitoring report is written, done
5. **If anomalies detected:** Slack gets an urgent alert, **GA4 Gap Analyzer** (Haiku) analyzes root cause patterns
6. **If gaps detected:** **GA4 Gap Analyzer** (Sonnet) generates a full gap analysis with GTM implementation specs
7. **Human reviews** the proposed changes in Slack, approves or rejects
8. **If approved:** **GTM Implementer** runs a preflight check, creates the workspace, and writes all resources with rate limiting
9. **Implementation docs** are generated from templates and saved alongside the monitoring report
10. **Final Slack message** includes a direct link to the GTM workspace for review before publishing

### Multiple Properties

One pipeline, many properties. The workflow logic is identical across all properties — only the configuration changes:

| Per-Property | Shared |
|--------------|--------|
| GA4 property ID + credentials | n8n workflow logic |
| GTM container ID + credentials | Claude analysis prompts |
| Event spec (expected events) | GTM tag creation patterns |
| Slack channel | Monitoring report templates |
| Schedule cadence | Approval flow pattern |
| Approvers list | Workspace lifecycle rules |

Adding a new property = creating a config JSON + event spec + scheduling a trigger. No workflow duplication.

### Claude Model Usage

| Task | Model | Why | Approx. Cost |
|------|-------|-----|-------------|
| Gap analysis + GTM spec generation | Sonnet | Needs deep reasoning about event relationships, trigger logic, and implementation tradeoffs | ~$0.05-0.10/run |
| Anomaly root cause analysis | Haiku | Pattern matching on volume changes, faster turnaround for urgent alerts | ~$0.01/run |

### GTM Write Safety

- **Rate-limited:** 4-second delays between GTM API calls (respects API quotas)
- **Idempotent:** reruns detect existing resources by name and skip duplicates
- **Workspace-isolated:** all changes land in a named workspace (`claude-{purpose}-{date}`), never in the default workspace
- **Preflight checks:** verifies workspace availability before attempting creation (free GTM accounts allow 3 workspaces total)
- **No publish permission:** the service account cannot publish containers by design

## Security Model

### Credential Isolation

- Service account JSON files are stored outside any synced directory and never committed to version control
- Each property gets its own service account with scoped permissions
- n8n credential storage handles encryption at rest

### Approval Gate

The pipeline has a hard stop before any GTM writes. Proposed changes are sent to Slack with full specs. A designated approver must explicitly approve before the pipeline continues. Rejection ends the run with logged reasoning.

### Workspace Isolation

GTM workspaces act like branches — changes are invisible to the live container until explicitly published by a human with publish permission. The service account intentionally lacks this permission, making accidental publication impossible at the API level.

### Audit Trail

Every pipeline run produces timestamped documentation:
- Monitoring reports (what was checked, what was found)
- Implementation docs (what was created, GTM resource IDs)
- Slack message history (approvals, rejections, alerts)

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Does this publish GTM changes automatically?</strong></summary>

No. The service account is configured without publish permission, and the pipeline creates changes in an isolated workspace. A human must review in the GTM UI and publish manually.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What happens if GTM already has 3 workspaces?</strong></summary>

The preflight check detects this and sends a Slack alert instead of failing. Free GTM accounts allow 3 workspaces total (including the default). The pipeline will not attempt to create a workspace if none are available.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I run this without the GTM implementation step?</strong></summary>

Yes. The monitoring and gap analysis stages work independently. You can use this purely for daily tracking health checks — just skip the approval step and the pipeline ends after the Slack notification with gap analysis results. You can also use the [GA4 Monitor](../../agents/ga4-monitor/) agent standalone for one-time audits.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I add a new property?</strong></summary>

1. Create a property config JSON (validate with `agents/ga4-monitor/scripts/validate-client-config.py`)
2. Create an event spec JSON (validate with `agents/ga4-monitor/scripts/validate-event-spec.py`)
3. Add a schedule trigger in n8n pointing to the new config
4. Set up the Google service account with GA4 read + GTM write access for the property

No workflow changes needed.
