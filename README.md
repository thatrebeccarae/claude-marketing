## Why I Built This

Most "AI marketing" skills, agents, and tools I've seen launch lately are just wrappers with an up-charge — skills that don't work, agents that are anything but 'autonomous', or just repackaging capabilities your platforms already ship natively, with a dashboard and a subscription fee. 

I have sat inside these platforms every day for years — Klaviyo, Shopify, GA4, GTM, analytics stacks, orchestration layers — and now I'm building agents, deploying pipelines, auditing what's actually in the box. 

**dgtl dept is a suite of specialized skills and proven workflows with built-in domain expertise.** No wrapper. No subscription. No dashboard selling you capabilities you already own. Just the focused knowledge, benchmarks, and diagnostic frameworks that make Claude Code useful for lean marketing teams — now open source, free, and built by someone who knows what a 1.2% welcome series click rate actually means.

- **Skill packs** give Claude Code the same platform expertise a senior marketing consultant brings to an audit
- **Agent workflows** are autonomous pipelines that monitor your GA4 properties, detect anomalies, and implement fixes via GTM — without you lifting a finger

I built the department my clients needed and I use every day because sometimes those $70K+/year solutions just aren't worth it. Now anyone can `git clone` it.

This is an active project and open-sourced as-is. Fork it, gut it, make it yours. Updates and new releases published regularly. 

Install the function you need, ask questions in plain English, get real answers.


## Who This Is For

- **Solo marketers and small teams** who need specialist depth without specialist headcount
- **DTC and e-commerce operators** running Klaviyo, Shopify, GA4, or Looker Studio
- **Growth teams** that need cross-platform analysis, not platform-by-platform reports
- **Agencies and consultants** who want to scale their diagnostic process
- **Founders** who are tired of paying for audits they could run themselves

If you want implementation-ready answers — not tutorials, not blog-post-level overviews — this is your department.

## What's Inside

| Category | What It Is | What's Available |
|----------|-----------|------------------|
| **[Skill Packs](skills/)** | Claude Code skills that give Claude specialist marketing expertise | [DTC Skill Pack](skills/dtc-skill-pack/) — 6 skills for e-commerce (Klaviyo, Shopify, GA4, Looker Studio, Pro Deck Builder) |
| **[Agent Workflows](workflows/)** | Autonomous pipelines that run on n8n + Claude, monitoring and acting without manual intervention | [Analytics Agents](workflows/analytics-agents/) — GA4 monitoring → Claude analysis → GTM implementation |

## Getting Started

### Setup Wizard (Recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thatrebeccarae/dgtldept.git
cd dgtldept/skills/dtc-skill-pack
python scripts/setup.py
```

The wizard checks prerequisites, walks you through API key setup, installs dependencies, and tests connections.

> [!TIP]
> The setup wizard validates API keys as you enter them and tests live connections before finishing. If something is misconfigured, it tells you exactly what to fix.

<details>
<summary><strong>Manual install (skip the wizard)</strong></summary>

```bash
# Run from the directory where you cloned the repo
cd dgtldept
for skill in klaviyo-analyst klaviyo-developer google-analytics shopify looker-studio pro-deck-builder; do
  cp -r skills/dtc-skill-pack/$skill ~/.claude/skills/
done
```

See [GETTING_STARTED.md](skills/dtc-skill-pack/GETTING_STARTED.md) for detailed API key setup per platform.

</details>

## How It Works

### Skill Packs

Claude Code skills are structured knowledge packs that load automatically when you invoke them. Each skill gives Claude specific domain expertise it doesn't have out of the box.

#### What a Skill Contains

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **SKILL.md** | Frontmatter + instructions Claude reads at invocation — frameworks, decision trees, diagnostic patterns |
| **REFERENCE.md** | Platform-specific data: industry benchmarks, API schemas, field mappings, rate limits |
| **EXAMPLES.md** | Working examples with realistic prompts and expected output format |
| **scripts/** | Utility scripts for setup, data fetching, health checks (where applicable) |

#### How Claude Uses Them

1. You ask a question in natural language (e.g., *"Audit my Klaviyo flows"*)
2. Claude loads the relevant skill's SKILL.md, which contains the diagnostic framework
3. Claude references REFERENCE.md for benchmarks, thresholds, and platform-specific data
4. If an MCP server is configured (e.g., Klaviyo), Claude pulls live data from your account
5. Claude delivers structured analysis with specific recommendations — not generic advice

> [!NOTE]
> Skills work without MCP servers too. You can paste data, share screenshots, or use the included scripts to export data manually. The MCP server just makes it seamless.

### Agent Workflows

Agent workflows are autonomous n8n pipelines that use Claude as their reasoning engine - I run local to save on costs, but do what's best for you. Unlike skills (which respond when you ask), workflows run on a schedule and act independently.

Each workflow includes:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **n8n workflow JSON** | The pipeline definition — import into your n8n instance |
| **Code node scripts** | JavaScript that handles API auth, data comparison, prompt construction, and API writes |
| **JSON schemas** | Validation schemas for config files and event specs |
| **Templates** | Report and documentation templates for generated output |

Workflows use Claude via the Anthropic API (not Claude Code) — Claude Sonnet for deep analysis, Claude Haiku for fast classification.

## Skill Packs

### [DTC Skill Pack](skills/dtc-skill-pack/) — 6 skills for e-commerce marketing

> [**View Live Demo**](https://thatrebeccarae.github.io/dgtldept/skills/dtc-skill-pack/demo/) — See all 6 skills in action with example terminal output.

| Skill | What Claude Can Do |
|-------|-------------------|
| **[Klaviyo Analyst](skills/dtc-skill-pack/klaviyo-analyst/)** | Full Klaviyo audit — 4-phase account review, flow gap analysis, segment health, deliverability diagnostics, revenue attribution, three-tier recommendations with implementation specs |
| **[Klaviyo Developer](skills/dtc-skill-pack/klaviyo-developer/)** | Event schema design, SDK integration, webhook handling, rate limit strategy, catalog sync, integration health audit |
| **[Shopify](skills/dtc-skill-pack/shopify/)** | 12-step store audit, conversion funnel analysis, site speed diagnostics, marketing stack integration |
| **[Google Analytics](skills/dtc-skill-pack/google-analytics/)** | GA4 traffic analysis, channel comparison, conversion funnels, content performance |
| **[Looker Studio](skills/dtc-skill-pack/looker-studio/)** | Cross-platform dashboards via Google Sheets pipeline, DTC dashboard templates, calculated field library |
| **[Pro Deck Builder](skills/dtc-skill-pack/pro-deck-builder/)** | Polished HTML slide decks and PDF-ready reports with dark cover pages and warm light content slides |

## Agent Workflows

Agent workflows are autonomous pipelines built on [n8n](https://n8n.io) + Claude that run on a schedule without manual intervention. They monitor, analyze, and act — then notify you with results.

### [Analytics Agents](workflows/analytics-agents/) — Autonomous GA4 monitoring + GTM implementation

Your GA4 property monitored daily, gaps analyzed by Claude, and fixes implemented in GTM — automatically.

| Stage | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|
| **Monitor** | Fetches all GA4 events daily, compares against your event spec |
| **Analyze** | Claude Sonnet identifies gaps and recommends GTM implementations; Claude Haiku detects anomalies |
| **Implement** | Creates GTM variables, triggers, and tags in an isolated workspace (unpublished until you review) |
| **Notify** | Slack messages at every stage — all-clear, gaps found, anomalies detected, GTM resources created |

Handles multiple GA4 properties — configure once per property, runs hands-off from there.

See the [Analytics Agents README](workflows/analytics-agents/README.md) and [Getting Started guide](workflows/analytics-agents/GETTING_STARTED.md) for setup.

### Coming Soon

The department is growing. Skill packs for Google Ads, Meta Ads, content strategy, and multi-channel attribution are in development. [Star the repo](https://github.com/thatrebeccarae/dgtldept/stargazers) to get notified when they drop.

## Example Prompts

```
"Audit my Klaviyo flows and identify which essential flows I'm missing"

"My checkout completion rate is 31% — what's causing the drop-off?"

"Which traffic sources are driving the most conversions this month?"

"Plan a CRM dashboard reconciling Klaviyo and Shopify data"

"Create a dark-mode deck summarizing this month's email performance"

"Debug why my webhook events aren't triggering flows"
```

## Configuration

### Setup Wizard Options

| Flag | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| `python scripts/setup.py` | Full interactive setup |
| `--skip-install` | Skip dependency installation |
| `--skills klaviyo,shopify` | Install specific skills only |
| `--non-interactive` | Use environment variables, skip prompts |

### API Keys by Platform

| Platform | Key Required | Where to Get It |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Klaviyo** | Private API Key (`pk_...`) | Klaviyo > Settings > API Keys |
| **Google Analytics** | Service account JSON + Property ID | Google Cloud Console > IAM > Service Accounts |
| **Shopify** | Admin API access token | Shopify Admin > Apps > Develop Apps |
| **Looker Studio** | Google Sheets API credentials | Google Cloud Console > APIs & Services |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> API keys are stored in `.env` files which are gitignored by default. Never hardcode keys in skill files or commit them to version control. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for full credential handling guidance.

<details>
<summary><strong>Klaviyo MCP server setup</strong></summary>

The [Klaviyo MCP server](https://developers.klaviyo.com/en/docs/klaviyo_mcp_server) gives Claude direct access to your Klaviyo account data.

1. Install uv: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
2. Add to `~/.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "klaviyo": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["klaviyo-mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "PRIVATE_API_KEY": "${KLAVIYO_API_KEY}",
        "READ_ONLY": "true",
        "ALLOW_USER_GENERATED_CONTENT": "false"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. Restart Claude Code and verify with `/mcp`

See the [DTC Skill Pack README](skills/dtc-skill-pack/README.md) for recommended Klaviyo API scopes.

</details>

## Security

All scripts include input validation, path sanitization, SSRF protection, and secure credential handling. Key principles:

- **API keys** stored in `.env` files (gitignored), never hardcoded
- **Read-only API access** by default — write scopes are opt-in
- **No PII extraction** — skills work with aggregates, not individual customer data
- **No persistent storage** — analysis runs in-memory, output goes to local files you control

For vulnerability reporting and full security design details, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>Skills not loading in Claude Code</strong></summary>

1. Verify skills are in the right directory: `ls ~/.claude/skills/`
2. Each skill folder should contain at least a `SKILL.md` file
3. Restart Claude Code after copying skills
4. Check that SKILL.md frontmatter is valid YAML

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>API key errors</strong></summary>

1. Confirm your `.env` file is in the project root (not inside a skill folder)
2. Klaviyo keys must start with `pk_` — if yours doesn't, you may have copied a public key
3. Google service account JSON path must be absolute, not relative
4. Run `python scripts/setup.py` to re-validate all keys

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Python version issues</strong></summary>

The setup wizard requires Python 3.8+. Check your version:

```bash
python --version
# or
python3 --version
```

On macOS, `python` may point to Python 2. Use `python3` explicitly or install via Homebrew: `brew install python`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>MCP server not connecting</strong></summary>

1. Verify `~/.mcp.json` syntax is valid JSON (no trailing commas)
2. Confirm `uv` is installed: `uv --version`
3. Check that your `KLAVIYO_API_KEY` environment variable is set: `echo $KLAVIYO_API_KEY`
4. Restart Claude Code — MCP servers load at startup

</details>
